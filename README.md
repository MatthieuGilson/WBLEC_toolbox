**These scripts have now been integrated in a toolbox, we recommend using the newer version:https://github.com/mb-BCA/notebooks_review2019**

**These scripts in Python 3 are a small package to analyze fMRI signals. It is a collaborative work with Andrea Insabato, Vicente Pallarés, Gorka Zamora-López and Nikos Kouvaris. If you use this toolbox, please cite the relevant papers below.**

## Whole-brain linear effective connectivity (WBLEC) estimation 

The script *ParameterEstimation.py* calculates the spatiotemporal functional connectivity for each session (or run) and subject from the BOLD time series. Then, it calls the model optimization (function in *WBLECmodel.py*) and stores the model estimates (effective connectivity matrix embedded in the Jacobian J and input variances Sigma) in an array.
The data are:
- BOLD time series in *ts_emp.npy*
- structural connectivity in *SC_anat.npy*
- ROI labels in *ROI_labels.npy*

## Classification

The script *Classification.py* compares the performances of two classifiers (multinomial linear regressor and 1-nearest-neighbor) in identifying subjects from EC taken as a biomarker.

The script *FeatureSelection.py* performs recursive feature elimination to identify the most informative EC connections for the rest-movie classification. It compares the resulting ranking for EC connections to the p-values obtained with statistical testing.
